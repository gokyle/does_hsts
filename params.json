{"google":"","body":"\r\nThis is a very simple Go command line utility that, given a list of sites\r\nto check, will determine whether those sites support \r\n[HSTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security).\r\n\r\n### Example usage\r\n```bash\r\n<monalisa: ~> $ does_hsts conformal.com google.com reddit.com\r\n[+] checking whether conformal.com supports HSTS: ok\r\n[+] checking whether google.com supports HSTS: not supported\r\n[+] checking whether reddit.com supports HSTS: SSL failure!\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Installing\r\ndoes_hsts requires the go compiler to be installed. See the Go language\r\nwebsite's [instructions](http://golang.org/doc/install) for installation. \r\nTo build, run `make`; installation defaults to /usr/local/bin and can be \r\ninstalled with `make install`. The `PREFIX` environment variable can be \r\nused to change the installation directory: `PREFIX=${HOME} make install` \r\nwould install to `${HOME}/bin`.\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
